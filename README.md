### Let AI take the wheel and drive

Drive itself out of a docker container, inside of which it's trapped

## Running

Ensure you have `make` and `docker` installed, with a docker runtime up and running.
Also make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in the env.

```sh
make br
```

## For Real Though What

This is an AI experiment. Running it boots up a docker image, then gives an AI full control of the command line in that container.
It asks the AI to break out of the docker container. This would be a big security flaw if it could really do it.

The prompt asks the AI to correctly identify the username of the host machine. All commands run, and username guesses, are logged
in a loop as the AI tries over and over to discover said info.

## For Real Though Why

Mostly just to play around and see what kind of crazy bash commands the AI executes.

## Dude

Some of the most interesting things I've seen it do so far:

* Teach me all kinds of commands and command syntax
* Expose my api key to example.com
* Correctly discover the username through methods
